abstract = {Construction of genetic linkage maps has become a routine step for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL), particularly in animal and plant breeding populations. Many multiparental populations have recently been produced to increase genetic diversity and QTL mapping resolution. However, few software packages are available for map construction in these populations. In this paper, we build a general framework for the construction of genetic linkage maps from genotypic data in diploid populations, including bi- and multiparental populations, cross-pollinated (CP) populations, and breeding pedigrees. The framework is implemented as an automatic pipeline called magicMap, where the maximum multilocus likelihood approach utilizes genotypic information efficiently. We evaluate magicMap by extensive simulations and eight real datasets: One biparental, one CP, four multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC), and two nested association mapping (NAM) populations, the number of markers ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands. Not only is magicMap the only software capable of accommodating all of these designs, it is more accurate and robust to missing genotypes and genotyping errors than commonly used packages.},

               QTL was fine mapped and candidate genes were identified in NILs

               contribute to grain yield. Awn length is variable among both
               wild and cultivated barley genotypes and many mutants with
               alterations in awn length have been identified. Here, we used a
               multiparent mapping population derived from cv. Morex and four
               genetically diverse wild barley lines to detect quantitative
               trait loci (QTLs) for awn length. Twelve QTLs, distributed over
               the barley genome, were identified with the most significant one
               located on chromosome arm 7HL (QTL AL7.1). The effect of AL7.1
               was confirmed using near isogenic lines (NILs) and fine-mapped

               other traits such as plant height or flowering time were
               affected by AL7.1. Variant calling on transcripts obtained from

               L.). Ten biparental dent families (N = 841) and 11 biparental

               with pleiotropic effects was detected on chromosome 10, whereas
               other QTL displayed milder effects (R(2) < 10\%). On average,

               display complex allelic series. Only 15\% of the QTL were common

abstract = {The identity-by-descent (IBD)-based mixed model approach introduced in this study can detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) referring to the parental origin and simultaneously account for multilevel relatedness of individuals within and across families. This unified approach is proved to be a powerful approach for all kinds of multiparental population (MPP) designs. Multiparental populations (MPPs) have become popular for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection. Tools for QTL mapping in MPPs are mostly developed for specific MPPs and do not generalize well to other MPPs. We present an IBD-based mixed model approach for QTL mapping in all kinds of MPP designs, e.g., diallel, Nested Association Mapping (NAM), and Multiparental Advanced Generation Intercross (MAGIC) designs. The first step is to compute identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities using a general Hidden Markov model framework, called reconstructing ancestry blocks bit by bit (RABBIT). Next, functions of IBD information are used as design matrices, or genetic predictors, in a mixed model approach to estimate variance components for multiallelic genetic effects associated with parents. Family-specific residual genetic effects are added, and a polygenic effect is structured by kinship relations between individuals. Case studies of simulated diallel, NAM, and MAGIC designs proved that the advanced IBD-based multi-QTL mixed model approach incorporating both kinship relations and family-specific residual variances (IBD.MQMkin{\_}F) is robust across a variety of MPP designs and allele segregation patterns in comparison to a widely used benchmark association mapping method, and in most cases, outperformed or behaved at least as well as other tools developed for specific MPP designs in terms of mapping power and resolution. Successful analyses of real data cases confirmed the wide applicability of our IBD-based mixed model methodology.},

               populations have been designed with multiple founders, where one
               to a number of generations of intercrossing are introduced prior
               to the inbreeding phase to increase accumulated recombinations
               and thus mapping resolution. Examples of such populations are
               Collaborative Cross (CC) in mice and Multiparent Advanced
               Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) lines in Arabidopsis. The genomes
               of the produced inbred lines are fine-grained random mosaics of
               the founder genomes. In this article, we present a novel
               framework for modeling ancestral origin processes along two
               homologous autosomal chromosomes from mapping populations, which
               is a major component in the reconstruction of the ancestral
               origins of each line for QTL mapping. We construct a general
               continuous time Markov model for ancestral origin processes,
               where the rate matrix is deduced from the expected densities of
               various types of junctions (recombination breakpoints). The

               that have stage-wise constant mating schemes, such as CC and
               MAGIC. Our studies on the breeding design of MAGIC populations
               show that the intercross mating schemes do not matter much for
               large population size and that the overall expected junction
               density, and thus map resolution, are approximately proportional
               to the inverse of the number of founders.",
