# statgenMPP 1.0.1

* The logic in the scan process is improved, leading to much lower computation times. * Computations can now be done in parallel by registering a parallel back-end and setting `parallel = TRUE` in the selQTLMPP function.
* readRABBIT is renamed to readRABBITMPP to prevent future conflicts with a similar function in statgenIBD

# statgenMPP 1.0.0

* Initial CRAN release
